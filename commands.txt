Here's how I got access to a Nexmo WeChat test account:

1. Install WeChat on your phone and create a WeChat user profile.
2. Sign up here for a Nexmo account: https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up
3. Send donovan.rose@@nexmo.com (the partnership manager) an email with the email address and mobile number you used to sign up.
4. Receive an email from Donovan with a QR code attached. 
5. From WeChat on your phone, scan the QR code.
